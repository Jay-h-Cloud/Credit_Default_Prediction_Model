# Credit Risk Default Prediction and Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for a credit risk default prediction project. The primary goal is to build a robust and **financially interpretable** machine learning model that helps a bank **understand default patterns, take early action, and effectively manage credit exposure.**

## Key Features:

-   **Data-driven Approach:** Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key financial indicators and behavioral patterns associated with credit default.
-   **Feature Engineering:** Creation of insightful features like `DELINQUENCY_COUNT` and `PAY_TO_BILL_ratio` to better capture customer repayment behavior and financial health.
-   **Advanced Machine Learning Models:** Implementation and evaluation of various classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost, LightGBM), with a focus on high-performing ensemble methods.
-   **Financial Interpretability with SHAP:** Extensive use of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to explain model predictions, identifying the most influential financial variables driving default (e.g., overdue payments, credit utilization, payment history, credit limit).
-   **Optimized for Business Impact:** Model evaluation prioritizes metrics crucial for credit risk (Recall, F2-score) to minimize missed defaults, and a customized classification cutoff is determined to facilitate proactive interventions.
-   **Actionable Business Insights:** Translates model findings into clear business implications for proactive risk management, optimized lending decisions, targeted customer engagement, and improved portfolio health.

This project goes beyond mere prediction, providing a deeper understanding of *why* customers default, empowering financial institutions with the knowledge to make informed decisions and mitigate risk effectively.
